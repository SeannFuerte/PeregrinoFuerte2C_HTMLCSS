				<h2 id="vision">Story</h2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;In the Burst arc of the game, the story revolves around the 1st Unit's search for Lindow Amamiya which results in the arrival of Ren and a new Aragami, the Corrosive Hannibal.</p>

				<h2 id="mission">Summary</h2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;Following the defeat of Director Schicksal, the Protagonist's God Arc begins to malfunction. After a successful mission against a new species of Aragami called Hannibal, despite Soma devouring its core, the monster gets back up and attacks Kota. The protagonist blocks the attack, damaging their God Arc's core in the process.
				<br><br>

				   &emsp;&emsp;The protagonist is then ordered to take some time off, during which the Den is attacked. Because all active God Eaters are out searching for Hannibal, nobody can protect the base, leading the protagonist to grab Lindow's God Arc. While they can use it for a while, eventually the Oracle Cells cause them immense pain and show them visions of Lindow howling to the moon. Fortunately, a new recruit called Ren arrives and saves them by shooting the invading Vajratail.
				   <br><br>

				   &emsp;&emsp;After a conversation with Ren, the protagonist finds out (through Resonance) that Lindow might still be alive, a fact that is confirmed after a long search. However, knowing that Lindow is very likely infected, the protagonist goes and fights the Corrosive Hannibal that Lindow had transformed into on their own.
				   <br><br>

				   &emsp;&emsp;After a dramatic display of dual wielding their own and Lindow's God Arcs, the protagonist, alongside Ren, enters Lindow's mind, where they find him struggling against the Corrosive Hannibal. Ren reveals he was Lindow's Arc all along and morphs back into Blade form, allowing Lindow to make a last stand against the monster. When the dark Hannibal overpowers both the protagonist and Lindow, Ren sacrifices himself to kill the monster and keep Lindow's infection contained in his right arm, allowing him to return to the Far East Branch, where he marries Sakuya and later has a son named Ren.

				<h2 id="history">Gameplay</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;The game possesses a large storyline which can be re-experienced through the Archive. Players play as a young, previously unemployed individual who has been enlisted as a "God Eater", warriors who face powerful creatures called "Aragami". The game boasts a mission-based single-player mode consisting of more than 100 missions, allowing co-operative play with up to 3 teammates which can be AI controlled or controlled by other players through Ad-hoc. The game also features character creation allowing customization of hairstyle, hair color, face, skin, voice, clothing, and weapons. Another feature of the game is full bullet customization, a first for the PSP. The game can be described as a high-speed hack'n'slash game with a post-apocalyptic plot. Players playing God Eater Burst get both the original God Eater storyline plus the Burst addition, effectively a 2 for 1 price for getting the game.
