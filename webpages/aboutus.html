				   &emsp;&emsp;In God Eater Burst, you step into a world on the brink of annihilation. The Earth, once a thriving planet, has been overrun by monstrous entities known as Aragami.

An elite force of warriors, known as the God Eaters, have emerged, armed with advanced biological weapons called God Arcs. These unique weapons, capable of transforming between powerful blades and high-impact guns, are humanity's last line of defense against the Aragami menace.
